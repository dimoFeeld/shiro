# Shiro theme for GNOME

Based on [Yaru theme](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru)

## Concept Mockups



It contains:
 * a GNOME Shell theme
 * a GTK2 and GTK3 theme
 * an icon & cursor theme, derived from the [Suru icon](https://snwh.org/suru) theme.
 * a sound theme, combining sounds from the [WoodenBeaver](https://github.com/madsrh/WoodenBeaver) and [Touch-Remix](https://github.com/madsrh/TouchRemix) sound themes with an emphasis on making sound a usability feature instead of an annoyance.
